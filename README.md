<h3>Overview</h3><br>
Here, I have performed a basic classification task with Tensorflow, identifying and dealing with overfitting through early stopping callbacks and dropout layers.<br>
It is done to classify if someone has a breast cancer or not using the attribute information from Breast cancer wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset.<br>The result classes are: benign and malign.<br>
